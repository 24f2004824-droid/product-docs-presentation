## Algorithmic Complexity

AwesomeApp utilizes optimized algorithms for sorting and searching.

For example, the core sorting mechanism has a time complexity of \( O(n \log n) \), ensuring efficiency for large inputs.

Space complexity is \( O(n) \) in the worst case.

Consider the following equation for performance estimation:  

\[ T(n) = a n \log n + b n + c \]  

where \( a, b, c \) are constants derived from benchmarking.
